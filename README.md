# A love affair with JavaScript

### This repo holds the remnants of the love triangle that lingers between Ajay Thorve, Roger Correia and JavaScript. Most of the topics and snippets come from the classes the authors have attended during their Masters program.

```javascript
'use-strict'
const aVariable = "I promise to follow good JavaScript principles";
//this variable will hold the values it holds for eternity!
```
